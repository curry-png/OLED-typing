# Steelseries-OLED
A collection of interactive functions and games designed to be displayed on the OLED screens of SteelSeries keyboards.

## How to download
Download and extract [Steelseries-OLED.zip](https://github.com/curry-png/SS-OLED-App/raw/main/Steelseries-OLED.zip), then run `SS OLED.exe`.

### Requirements
- **Windows 10/11**. Other OSs were not tested.
- **Steelseries GG** is required for displaying to the OLED<sup>1</sup>.

### Troubleshooting
If it is laggy, try decreasing the `FPS` in `settings.json`.

<sup>1</sup>The images will be displayed in the console window if SS Engine is not found (can be enabled manually with `bDisplayInConsole` in `settings.json`).

## Features
