# OLED-typing (cat version)

## **WARNING:** I'm still working on it, and there may be bugs. 
I am not liable for any damage or issues that occur while the program runs. It shouldn't cause any issues, but I make no promises.
 
## **Requirements** to minimise issues
- Windows 10
- you are using a Steelseries Apex 5/7/Pro (and TKLs) keyboard
- There is a `coreProps.json` file in `C:\ProgramData\SteelSeries\SteelSeries Engine 3`

Note: antivirus software may block `keypress.exe` as it detects what keys you press. It is required for the app to work.

GLHF :D
