# Steelseries-OLED [Work in Progress]
A collection of interactive functions and games designed to be displayed on the OLED screens of SteelSeries keyboards.

## How to download
Download and extract [Steelseries-OLED.zip](https://github.com/curry-png/SS-OLED-App/raw/main/Steelseries-OLED.zip), then run `SS OLED.exe`.

### Requirements
- **Windows 10/11**. Other OSs were not tested.
- **Steelseries GG** is required for displaying to the OLED<sup>1</sup>.

### Troubleshooting
#### Known Bug: Num Lock
If a numpad key AND numlock key is pressed at the same time, the num pad key "gets stuck" and makes the program play the wrong animation. To fix it, just turn numlock on/off and press the numpad keys one at a time until the key gets unstuck... Looking into a fix, as well as a slight rework of everything.

If it is laggy, try decreasing the `FPS` in `settings.json`.

<sup>1</sup>The images will be displayed in the console window if SS Engine is not found (can be enabled manually with `bDisplayInConsole` in `settings.json`).

## Features
### Typing Cat (Bongo Cat, but with a keyboard)
The cat types when you type... thats basically it.
